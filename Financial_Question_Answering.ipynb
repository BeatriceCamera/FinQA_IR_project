        "This notebook presents a systematic investigation of LLM-based Query Expansion in financial information retrieval, with a specific focus on effects of sentiment polarity manipulation. While large language models have shown strong capabilities in enriching search queries with domain-specific knowledge, the consequences of deliberately steering query expansions toward positive or negative sentiment remain underexplored, particularly in the context of financial opinion retrieval.\n",

        "We designed a controlled experimental framework that compares a hybrid retrieval baseline (BM25 combined with Bi-Encoder re-ranking) against three sentimental-controlled query expansion strategies: neutral, positive (bullish) and negative (bearish). Query expansions are generated using an instruction-following language model and are cached to ensure reproducibility across experiments.\n",

        "To answer this question, we quantify the impact of sentiment-controlled expansions using standard information retrieval metrics, including MAP, nDCG, Precision@k and Recall@k. In addition, we explicitly verify the induced polarity of the expansions using a financial sentiment classifier, allowing us to separate the effects of query enrichment from those of sentiment bias. Through this analysis, we assess whether sentiment-oriented expansions improve the retrieval of financial opinions or instead introduce semantic noise that degrades relevance and objectivity.  "

Even with a fixed candidate set, R@10 improves from 0.309 to 0.423, proving that neural re-ranking successfully elevates relevant documents that lexical matching had ranked lower."

This is reflected in the Negative expansion, which successfully shifts the focus toward 'scam detection', 'fraud warning signs', and 'credibility ratings'.

This design ensures computational efficiency, reproducibility, and strict separation between generation and evaluation phases.\n",

Expanded queries are constructed by appending a fixed number of cached expansion terms to the original query, followed by a final normalization step to ensure consistent lexical processing.\n",

The results reveal a clear hierarchy of performance: *Original > Neutral > Negative > Positive*. The drop in metrics suggests that while LLM-generated terms are domain-relevant, they introduce a 'semantic dilution' that shifts the focus away from the concise intent of the original financial queries. Notably, Neutral QE retains the most stability, whereas Positive QE incurs the heaviest penalty, suggesting that bullish terminology is particularly prone to introducing noise in this specific corpus"

        "In this study, we conducted a systematic evaluation of how induced sentiment polarity in Large Language Model (LLM) query expansion influences the effectiveness of financial information retrieval. Our investigation began with an extensive baseline phase, establishing a performance ceiling through traditional lexical methods, including TF-IDF, BM25, and the BM25+RM3 pseudo-relevance feedback mechanism. These benchmarks were subsequently compared against an advanced retrieval pipeline, which utilized BM25 for candidate retrieval followed by a Bi-Encoder semantic re-ranker without query expansion. This hybrid architecture provided a high-precision baseline for our primary experiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core of our research involved the generation of three sentiment-controlled query expansion variants: Neutral, Positive (Bullish), and Negative (Bearish). To ensure the integrity of our experimental variables, we performed a rigorous bias verification via sentiment analysis using the Finbert classifier. This step confirmed that the LLM successfully generated distinct clusters of sentiment-laden terms, providing a valid foundation for evaluating our hybrid pipeline under four distinct query conditions (Original, Neutral, Positive, and Negative).\n",
        "\n",
        "The empirical results demonstrate that while the hybrid pipeline is highly effective for original queries, the introduction of sentiment-oriented expansion terms leads to a measurable decrease in retrieval metrics such as MAP and nDCG. This phenomenon is primarily attributed to Query Drift: by intentionally steering the expansion toward specific polarities, the semantic focus of the query is shifted away from the user’s original information need. In the financial domain, where precision is paramount, even domain-relevant terms can act as semantic noise if they emphasize sentiment over the core factual or advisory intent of the query.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, our analysis revealed a notable polarity asymmetry. Negative-biased expansions proved to be more resilient than positive ones, suffering a less severe degradation in performance. This suggests that the vocabulary associated with financial risk and bearish outlooks is more semantically aligned with the technical and cautious nature of the FinQA dataset. Ultimately, these findings indicate that while LLMs are powerful tools for knowledge enrichment, the strategic induction of sentiment introduces a trade-off between semantic breadth and retrieval precision, highlighting the sensitivity of hybrid IR systems to linguistic steering."

        "Despite the insights gained, this study is subject to certain limitations. First, the use of a relatively small language model (`Qwen-1.5B`) may have limited the linguistic diversity and technical depth of the expansions compared to larger frontier models. Second, our analysis was restricted to the FinQA dataset, which primarily consists of forum-style peer-to-peer discussions; consequently, the observed \"polarity asymmetry\" might vary in more formal financial news or regulatory corpora.\n",
        "\n",
        "Future research should explore dynamic expansion filtering, where LLMs are instructed to prune noise-heavy terms before the retrieval phase. Additionally, investigating cross-domain resilience would determine if sentiment-induced query drift is unique to finance or a universal characteristic of hybrid IR systems. Finally, implementing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting could help the model better align expansions with the specific financial logic of the query, potentially mitigating the performance decay observed in this study."
